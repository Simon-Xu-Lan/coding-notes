- Standard Deviation
  - The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are
  - a measure of the extent to which data varies from the mean.
  - If the data is close together, the standard deviation will be small.
  - if the data is spread out, the standard deviation will be large.
  - **Describes how spread out the data is from the mean**
  - Calculated from the square root of the variance
  - In the same units of measurement as the mean
- Variance
  - The average of the **squared** differences from the Mean
  - measures the average degree to which each number is different from the mean.
  - **Used to describe how far values in the data set are from the mean**
  - **Describes how much variation exists in the data**
  - **Variance considers the distance of each value in the data set from the center of the data**
  - describe the variability of the observations from its arithmetic mean
  - Variance measure how far individuals in the group are spread out from the mean
  - the variance is greater when there is a wider range of numbers in the group.
  - the variance is less when there is a narrower range of numbers.
- Mean
  - The arithmetic average
  - The **AVERAGE** OF ALL NUMBERS
- Midium
  - The number in the **MIDDLE** when they are IN ORDER
- Mode

  - The most repetitive nmber

- Z-Score
  - Describe **a single value's distance** from the mean of the data set
  - The distance is in terms of standard deviations
  - Can be positive or negative
    - if positive, the value is greater than the mean
    - if negative, the value is less than the mean
  - The smaller the z-score, the closer the value is to the mean
