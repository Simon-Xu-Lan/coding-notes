# Sign in postgresql to superuser's account

- When you installed SQL, it automatically generated one more user on your server called postgres.
- This new user is an SQL superuser.
- sign in to this superuser‚Äôs account with this command:
  - sudo -i -u postgres\*
  ```terminal
  sudo -i -u postgres
  ```
  - The superuser will be able to access SQL with this simple command (type it):
  ```terminal
  psql
  ```

## let‚Äôs generate a new user, so you can access your database in the future with your normal user too (which is the preferred way).

## You can exit from postgreSQL and go back to bash!

\q

## log out from the superuser as well and go back to your normal user

exit

## login with your normal user to your SQL database with this command:

psql -U dataguy -d postgres

## Exit from postgreSQL

\q

# SQL writing order:

1. SELECT
2. FROM
3. WHERE
4. GROUP BY
5. ORDER BY
6. LIMIT

# SQL execution order - That computer uses:

- Simple

1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. SELECT
5. ORDER BY
6. LIMIT

- SQL first checks which data table we will work with.
- Then it checks the filters.
- After that it groups the data.
- Finally it gets the data
- and if necessary, sorts it
- and prints only the first X rows.

## the order of the SQL keywords your computer sees when processing your query:

1. FROM
2. ON
3. JOIN
4. WHERE
5. GROUP BY
6. SELECT
7. DISTINCT
8. ORDER BY
9. LIMIT

## Execution order:

1. filtering
2. grouping
3. function

# SQL Indentations and new lines:

- Spaces and line breaks do not affect the outcome of an SQL query.
- The only thing that matters is the semicolon (;) that clearly indicates the end of the SQL query.

# SQL style:

- Use line breaks at least before the main SQL keywords (e.g. SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.).
- Actually, I prefer to use line breaks before column names, table names, and each WHERE condition too‚Ä¶
- Use indentation for column names, WHERE conditions (especially with AND, OR) and similars!
- Stay consistent!

- Exqmple:

```sql
SELECT
  animal,
  water_need
FROM
  zoo
WHERE
  animal LIKE '_____'
  AND animal <> 'tiger'
  AND water_need > 200;
```

# Visualize your SQL data in Google Data Studio!

## connect Google Data Studio to PostgreSQL https://data36.com/connect-google-data-studio-postgresql/

0.  Register for Google Data Studio. https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/

- It‚Äôs free; all you need is a gmail email address.

1.  Add a new Data Source!

# in SQL, you can‚Äôt use nested functions, like MIN(AVG(depdelay))

- aggregate function calls cannot be nested.

# SQL subquery syntax requirements

- your inner query must go between parentheses (( and ))
- subquery in FROM must have an alias
  - your inner query must get a new ‚Äúname‚Äù with aliasing
  - so after the parentheses add this: AS new_name‚Ä¶ except that of course you should replace new_name with something more meaningful. üôÇ

# SQL CASE (the ‚Äúif statement‚Äù of SQL)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*),
  CASE WHEN depdelay < 0 THEN 'early'
       WHEN depdelay > 0 THEN 'late'
       ELSE 'ontime'
  END as segment
FROM flight_delays
GROUP BY segment
LIMIT 10;
```

- the CASE WHEN part of your query categorizes the flights, based on the depdelay column, into 3 categories.

```sql
SELECT *,
  CASE WHEN depdelay < 0 THEN 'early'
       WHEN depdelay > 0 THEN 'late'
       ELSE 'ontime'
  END as segment
FROM flight_delays
LIMIT 10;
```

- CASE WHEN statement is creating a new column at the end of the table.

# HAVING

- HAVING is for filtering on the results of SQL functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
- HAVING is the new WHERE ‚Äì at least for the aggregated values in your SQL query.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as nmbr,
       dest
FROM flight_delays
GROUP BY dest
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10000;
```

- **The only unfortunate thing is that you can‚Äôt use your aliases with your HAVING, so you need to type the whole COUNT(\*) function again**

# Extra parameters when create table

- NOT NULL:
  - If you add this, you can‚Äôt add NULL values to the given column.
- UNIQUE:
  - If you add this, you can‚Äôt add the same value to the column twice.
  - This is especially important when you store unique user IDs, for instance.
- PRIMARY KEY:
  - Practically speaking, this is a combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE
  - but it also has some technical advantages.
  - You can have only one PRIMARY KEY column per table.

# How to Import Data into SQL Tables

1. add the data line by line.  
   **INSERT INTO **\_ VALUES (\_\_**);**

```sql
INSERT INTO test_results
VALUES
('Jesse', 2, '1988-02-11', 74.00, 'C', TRUE),
('Todd', 3, '1987-06-13', 60.00, 'D', TRUE),
('Tuco', 4, '1970-11-11', 15.50, 'F', FALSE),
('Gus', 5, '1975-08-08', 80.00, 'B', TRUE)
;

-- Don't format commit for online server
```

2. import the data from a .csv file.

- **COPY \_**\_ FROM '\_\_\_**' DELIMITER ' ';**

```sql
COPY accidents
FROM '/home/[your_user_name]/accidents.csv'
WITH CSV HEADER DELIMITER',';

-- another solution:
COPY flight_delays FROM '/home/dataguy/sql_ready.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

- COPY method postgreSQL
  https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/

- COPY is the SQL keyword.
- table_name is the name of the table that you want to put the data into. (This is not intuitive if you just look at the syntax.)
- FROM is another SQL keyword.
- Then you have to specify the filename and the location of the file that you want to copy the data from between apostrophes.
- And eventually you have to specify the field separator in your original file by typing DELIMITER and the field separator itself between apostrophes.

  - ',' means that the delimiter would be a comma.
  - ' ' means that the delimiter would be a space.

- A few comments on the .csv import method
  1.  typed \COPY and not just COPY because my SQL user doesn‚Äôt have SUPERUSER privileges,
  - so technically I could not use the COPY command (this is an SQL thing).
  - Typing \COPY instead is the simplest workaround
  - but the best solution would be to give yourself SUPERUSER privileges then use the original COPY command.
  2. The '/home/dataguy/test_results.csv' is the location of the file and the name of the file, together.
  - we found out the location by using the pwd command in the right folder.

3. add rows to your new SQL table that are the results of another SQL query.

- **INSERT INTO \_**\_ (SELECT \_\_**);**

# empty your table without deleting the table

- Say we want to create a table where we want to store only the names from our test_results table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_names
(
name TEXT
);

-- Use the INSERT INTO statement
-- put a SELECT statement at the end of the query.
INSERT INTO student_names
(SELECT name FROM test_results);

-- You can even combine this method with SQL functions.
INSERT INTO test_averages
(SELECT AVG(test_result) FROM test_results);
```

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE test_results;
```

# Example:

1. Which 3 cities have the highest proportion of reported accidents?

## Solution 1:

- Using JOIN

```SQL
SELECT
  accidents_by_city.city,
  reported_by_city.reported::float / accidents_by_city.total::float AS ratio
FROM
  (SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total
  FROM accidents
  GROUP BY city) AS accidents_by_city
JOIN
  (SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS reported
  FROM accidents
  WHERE reported = 'true'
  GROUP BY city) AS reported_by_city
ON accidents_by_city.city = reported_by_city.city
ORDER BY ratio DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

-Solution 2

- Using CASE to create a new column

```SQL
SELECT city,
       reported_yes / total_num::float AS ratio
FROM (SELECT city,
             COUNT(*) AS total_num,
             COUNT(CASE WHEN reported = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS reported_yes
      FROM accidents
      GROUP BY city) AS foo
ORDER BY ratio DESC LIMIT 3;
```
