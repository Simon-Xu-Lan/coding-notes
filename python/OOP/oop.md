- Object-oriented programming (OOP)

  - is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
  - An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
  - OOP is a programming language model organized around object rather than actions (logic and functions);
  - In other words, OOP mainly focuses on the objects that are required to be manipulated instead of logic.
  - It makes development and maintenance easier
  - It provides data hiding
  - It provides ability to simulate real-world

- OOP language follow 4 principles:

  1. ENCAPSULATION:
     - We can hide direct access to data by using private key and we can access private data by using getter and setter method.
  2. ABSTRACTION:

     - It is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
     - Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

  3. INHERITANCE:

     - It is used to define the relationship between two classes. When a child class acquires all properties and behaviors of parent class known as inheritance.
     - Child class can reuse all the codes written in parent class.
     - It provides the code reusability.

  4. POLYMORPHISM: "多态性“
     - It is an ability of object to behave in multiple form.
     - The most common use of polymorphism is Java, when a parent class reference type of variable is used to refer to a child class object.
