| Library is a set of resuable functions used by computer programs.                                          | Framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of your project and aids in programs                     |
| You are in full control when you call a method from a library and the control is then returned             | The code never calls into a framework, instead teh framework calls you                                               |
| It's incorporated seamlessly into existing projects to add functionality that you can access using an API. | It cannot be seamlessly incorporated into an existing project. Instead it can be used when a new project is started. |
| They are important in program linking and binding process.                                                 | They provide a standard way to build and deploy applications                                                         |
| Example: jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies COM manipulation.                                  | Example: AngularJS is a JavaScript-based framework for dynamic web applications.                                     |
