unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this.
Arrow functions donâ€™t redefine the value of this within their function body. This makes it a lot easier to predict their behavior when passed as callbacks,

## Inside a function, the value of this depends on how the function is called.

## regular funciton

- this is the who call the function

## arrow function

- this is the who define the function
