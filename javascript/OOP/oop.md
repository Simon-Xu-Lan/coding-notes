# What is OOP

- Object-Oriented Programming
- OOP is a programming paradigm or pattern of programming centered around objects.
- Problems are thought of in a way in which a collection of objects work together to solve a problem.
- Objects can speak to one another,
- and this ability makes them suitable for managing and solving large and complex problems.

# Encapsulation

- Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly

# Inheritance

- We can create new classed based on other classes

# Abstraction

- Creating a simple model of a more complexing thing

# Polymorphism

- The fancy word for the ability of mulitple object types to implement the same functionality
