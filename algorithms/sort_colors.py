# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
# sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent,
# with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

# You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
# You should do it in-place (sort numbers in the original array).
